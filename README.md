# NFT Rarity Scoring Module

## Overview
The `NftRarityScoring` Move smart contract allows users to mint NFTs with AI-calculated rarity scores and update the rarity score dynamically. This provides a transparent and dynamic way to assess NFT values based on rarity.

## Features
- **Mint NFTs with Rarity Scores**: Users can mint NFTs with a predefined rarity score.
- **Update Rarity Scores**: Owners can update the rarity score of their NFTs as needed.
- **Secure Ownership Handling**: The contract ensures that only the NFT owner can update its rarity score.

## Smart Contract Code
```move
module MyModule::NftRarityScoring {
    use aptos_framework::signer;
    use aptos_framework::object;

    /// Struct representing an NFT with a rarity score.
    struct NftRarity has key, store {
        owner: address,
        rarity_score: u64,
    }

    /// Function to mint an NFT with an AI-calculated rarity score.
    public entry fun mint_nft(owner: &signer, rarity_score: u64) {
        let nft = NftRarity {
            owner: signer::address_of(owner),
            rarity_score,
        };
        move_to(owner, nft);
    }

    /// Function to update the rarity score of an NFT.
    public entry fun update_rarity(owner: &signer, new_score: u64) acquires NftRarity {
        let nft = borrow_global_mut<NftRarity>(signer::address_of(owner));
        nft.rarity_score = new_score;
    }
}
```

## Functions
1. **`mint_nft(owner: &signer, rarity_score: u64)`**
   - Mints an NFT with a specified rarity score.
   - The NFT is assigned to the owner.

2. **`update_rarity(owner: &signer, new_score: u64)`**
   - Allows the NFT owner to update its rarity score.
   - Ensures only the owner can modify the rarity score.

## Usage
1. Deploy the `NftRarityScoring` module on the Aptos blockchain.
2. Call `mint_nft` to create an NFT with an initial rarity score.
3. Use `update_rarity` to modify the rarity score of an existing NFT.

## Security Considerations
- Only the owner of an NFT can update its rarity score.
- The contract prevents unauthorized modifications to NFT attributes.
- Future versions may incorporate automated AI-driven rarity updates.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with marketplace platforms for rarity-based pricing.
- Automated rarity recalculations based on external data sources.
- Multi-asset support for NFTs across different collections.

## Contract Address & Transaction
- **Contract Address**: `0xYourContractAddressHere`
- **Example Transaction Hash**: `0xYourTransactionHashHere`

This module enables NFT creators and collectors to dynamically assess and manage NFT rarity, enhancing the overall ecosystem.
